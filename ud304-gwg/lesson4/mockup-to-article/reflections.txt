You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

## What new skills have you learned?

I've learned new tags like <figure> and <sup>.

From the forum -- https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/#media-fallback

## What has been easy?

I started using HTML in 1996 for a high school summer program at a local university. While some things have 
changed, many have stayed the same. This material has been mostly review for me and has felt 'easy'.

## What has been difficult?

The difficult part has been making sure I read through the material and take it seriously.  When I've seen 
material before, I tend to fall into the trap of thinking that I already know everything and have nothing to 
pick up. Then, I worry that I may have missed something because of overconfidence.

It's hard to figure out what you're testing. I ended up looking at the tests.json files and the 
source for one of your mock-ups as a sanity check, and I probably shouldn't have needed to do that. If you want
something exactly like a mock-up and you provide a link to an existing site as inspiration, then do you want
students to take initiative to also include css and other style constraints from that inspiration to make sure
that it is exact? If I were an instructor, I'd say no... but then why are you including the link? Maybe you're
including the link just to make sure you cite the original work?

There are a zillion ways of doing things. What's going to be of value to someone at Udacity? The mock-up 
inspiration didn't use the time tag, but it was suggested as feedback from one of the mentors 
'<p><time datetime="2016-03-10">March 10, 2016</time></p>'. 

On the flip side, I don't have a lot of time, and I worry that I'm spending too much time on making sure my 
overconfidence doesn't get the best of me, instead of focusing on learning the course material and actually 
getting through it all. I imagine as the topics get more difficult, this will be less of a problem. I also 
worry that my working on a more basic course instead of something more intermediate or advanced will end up 
being a waste of time, especially if I don't get the scholarship in the next phase.

## How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

The HTML elements reference (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) has been a good resource
to look up tags.
